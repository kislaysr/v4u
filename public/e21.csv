Abdominal Pain,"Pain in the belly (abdomen) can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (for 
example, skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity (for 
example, beneath the skin and muscles). These organs include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Occasionally, pain may be felt in the abdomen even though it is arising from organs that are close to but not within the abdominal cavity, for example, the lower lungs, the kidneys, and the uterus or ovaries. This latter type of pain is called ""referred"" pain because the pain, though originating outside the abdomen, is being referred to (felt) in the abdominal area."
,"Abdominal pain can be acute and sudden in onset, or the 
pain can be chronic and longstanding. Abdominal pain may be minor and of no 
great significance, or it can reflect a major problem involving one of the 
organs in the abdomen. The characteristics of the pain -- location, timing, 
duration, etc. are important in diagnosing its cause. Persisting abdominal pain 
should be evaluated by a physician."
Abnormal Facial Expressions,"Abnormal facial expressions can occur as a result of conditions that damage the nerves to the face, such as Bell's palsy or facial paralysis. Damage to the brain, such as with stroke or transient ischemic attack, can also cause impaired movement, including changes in facial expressions. Patients with a number of psychiatric conditions may display abnormal facial expressions, particularly the psychotic disorders, in which an individual's sense of reality is impaired. Facial tics, such as those that occur in Tourette syndrome, are one form of abnormal facial expressions. "

Absence of Speech (Loss of Speech),"
Lack of speech or absence of speech can occur due to both medical and psychological conditions. Absent speech or mutism can occur as a sign of catatonia, a state in which one is unresponsive but otherwise awake. Catatonia can be a sign or schizophrenia or other psychiatric conditions involving psychosis. It may also be a sign of severe depression or other emotional disorders. The antipsychotic medications listed below are used in the treatment of emotional conditions that may manifest as catatonia with lack of speech."
,"
Aphasia is a term used to describe the loss of language or the ability to communicate, typically due to brain damage. Mutism is a speech disorder characterized by the inability to speak. Lack of speech development in children can occur due to deafness or hearing problems. In people who have developed speech, the onset of inability to speak can signal a stroke or other type of brain damage. Head injury, dementia, and brain tumors may be associated with the loss of speech or language functions.

Acid Reflux (GERD) Symptoms and Signs,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or acid reflux, has a number of different causes. The symptoms of acid reflux are caused by the regurgitation of acidic liquid stomach contents back up into the esophagus. Heartburn is the pain characteristically associated with acid reflux and results from irritation of the lining of the esophagus. Some cases of heartburn can produce sharp chest pains in the mid-chest that can be mistaken for the pain of angina. Heartburn is typically worse when an individual lies down after eating and occurs most commonly after mealtimes."
,"
Other symptoms that can occur as a result of GERD include nausea, regurgitation (the presence of regurgitated stomach contents in the mouth), and acid-induced erosions of the teeth. The nausea may be severe and lead to vomiting. Certain foods, including peppermint, tomatoes, spicy foods, citrus fruits, alcohol, or caffeinated drinks, may worsen the symptoms."
Acute Sinusitis Symptoms and Signs,"
The symptoms of acute sinusitis arise from inflammation of the lining tissues of the paranasal sinuses. This condition often occurs with rhinitis (inflammation of the lining of the nose), and symptoms can include nasal congestion, runny nose, nasal pressure, headache, fever, cough, and tenderness of the face over the areas of the sinuses. Other symptoms that can be related to sinusitis are tooth pain, jaw pain, postnasal drip, redness of the nose, reddened cheeks, red eyelids, decreased sense of taste, decreased sense of smell, ear fullness, and nasal drainage. Generalized symptoms like fatigue are also typical.

ADHD (Inattention),"
Inattention is the lack of focus when focus on a given event or situation is required. Inattention is a hallmark feature of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can affect adults as well as children and teens. Inattention in ADHD is often accompanied by symptoms such as restlessness, problems doing quiet activities, problems with executive function, talking excessively, and fidgeting.  Inattention can also occur due to external factors such as distractions as well as situations of emotional stress, anxiety, conflict, anger, or other mood changes. Inattention can also be related to medical problems that interfere with an individual's cognitive function, such as stroke or dementia. Inattention can be seen in typical young children and  is classified as a disorder only when present to excess and accompanied by problems with normal function. Depression and related conditions can cause mood changes that may include lack of attention and interest in normal daily activities."

Alcohol Poisoning Symptoms and Signs,"
Alcohol poisoning is a term used by many people to refer to alcohol overdose. Alcohol overdose can cause a number of serious health consequences, including coma and death. In addition to the typical symptoms of drunkenness, which begin early in the process, alcohol poisoning also affects breathing, regulation of body temperature, and can lead to seizures. Alcohol also inhibits the gag reflex, which means that people with alcohol overdose may choke on their own vomit. Hypothermia (low body temperature) and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) are complications of alcohol poisoning along with irregular heartbeat and slowed and irregular breathing."
,"
Alcohol poisoning or overdose results from the consumption of a large amount of alcoholic beverages over a short time, referred to as binge drinking.
"
Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms and Signs,"
Alcohol withdrawal occurs when a person who is accustomed to drinking large amounts of alcohol suddenly stops drinking alcohol. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually are most severe after 48 to 72 hours, but they can persist for weeks. A severe form of alcohol withdrawal is called delirium tremens (DT)."
,"
Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can include depression, anxiety, fatigue, nervousness, nightmares, jumpiness, mood swings, insomnia, 
and nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms can include sweating, tremor, pallor, rapid heart rate, headache, and dilated pupils. Symptoms of DT are more severe and may consist of seizures, fever, hallucinations, confusion, and agitation. DT may also cause fear, delirium, decreased attention span, and other changes in mental function.

Allergy,"Allergies are exaggerated immune responses to environmental triggers known as allergens. Allergies are very common, and about 50 million people in North America suffer from allergies. One of the most common forms of allergy is allergic rhinitis (""hay fever""), which produces symptoms like"
," The symptoms of hay fever can, in turn, lead to fatigue and lethargy. Other types of allergic reactions can involve the skin (hives and itching). Anaphylactic shock is a severe form of allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. In anaphylactic shock, there is swelling of the throat and difficulty breathing. Asthma is also related to allergies in many cases."
Altered Mental Status,"An alteration in mental status refers to general changes in brain function, such as confusion,  amnesia (memory loss), loss of alertness, 
disorientation (not cognizant of self, time, or place), defects in judgment or thought, unusual or strange behavior, poor regulation of emotions, and disruptions in perception, psychomotor skills, and behavior. While an altered mental status is obviously characteristic of a number of psychiatric and emotional conditions, medical conditions and injuries that cause damage to the brain, including 
alcohol or drug overdose and withdrawal syndromes, can also cause mental status changes. Confusion, lethargy, delirium, dementia, encephalopathy, and organic brain syndrome are all terms that have been used to refer to conditions hallmarked by mental status changes."

Anal Itching,"Anal itching (pruritus ani) is due to irritation of the skin around the anus accompanied by a desire to scratch. The intensity of itching increases with moisture, pressure, and sitting. At its most intense, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort described as burning and soreness. Scratching only makes the discomfort worse.  Treatment of anal itching is to shower gently without directly rubbing or irritating the skin and to clean and pat dry the anus thoroughly. Use of moist pads rather than toilet paper after bowel movements can be helpful. Local application of cortisone cream may also reduce inflammation and itching, though prolonged use of cortisone may be damaging to the skin. If anal itching is prolonged, a physician should be consulted and a search made for the cause."
,"Causes of anal itching include, but are not limited to, insufficient cleaning, ingesting spicy foods, diarrhea, anal tear, fungal infection, hemorrhoids, pinworms, anal abrasion, anal leakage, incontinence, and weeping."
Anaphylaxis Symptoms and Signs,"
Anaphylaxis is a rare, severe allergic reaction that is life-threatening. The most common allergic triggers of anaphylaxis include drugs (such as penicillin), 
insect stings, 
foods (peanuts, shellfish), X-ray dye, and 
latex. Symptoms 
and signs can vary and begin either immediately after contact with the allergen or after a short time period (15 minutes to an hour).  Hives, difficulty breathing, a feeling of impending doom, and reduced blood pressure are among the symptoms 
and signs that can occur. The severity of symptoms and signs varies among people; the more rapid the onset of symptoms 
and signs, the greater the likelihood of a severe reaction.

Appendicitis Symptoms and Signs,"
Abdominal pain is the main symptom of appendicitis. The pain starts out as diffuse, meaning it is difficult to localize the area of pain. Most people say the initial pain of appendicitis occurs around the middle portion of the abdomen. As the inflammation of the appendix progresses, the pain becomes localized to one area. Once the peritoneum (lining tissue of the abdomen) is inflamed, the pain of appendicitis is characteristically located at a point between the navel and the front of the right hip bone. Anatomically, this is referred to as McBurney's point."
,"
Another frequent symptom of appendicitis is loss of appetite. Over time, this can worsen, resulting in nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms that can occur are swelling of the abdomen, the inability to pass gas, constipation or diarrhea with 
gas, and a mild to moderate fever."
Arm Pain,"
Pain in the arm can result from a number of factors. Abnormalities or injury of the skin, nerves, bones, joints, blood vessels, and soft tissues of the arm can all result in pain. Arm pain, depending on the location and cause, may be accompanied by numbness, redness, swelling, tenderness, or stiffness of the joints. Injuries or trauma to any part of the arm or shoulder, including bone fractures, joint dislocations, and muscle strains and sprains, are common causes of arm pain. Sometimes diseases that affect other organs in the body, like peripheral vascular disease or arthritis, can be the cause of pain in the arm. Causes of arm pain range from mild annoyances to severe and potentially life-threatening occurrences, such as chest pain from myocardial infarction (heart attack) and angina pectoris that may radiate (spread) to the arm area. The pain of a heart attack can be accompanied by nausea, difficulty breathing, a sense of pressure on the chest, and other symptoms. Treatments for arm pain depend on the underlying cause."

Avian Influenza (Bird Flu (Avian Influenza) Symptoms and Signs),"
Bird flu (avian flu or avian influenza) is type of influenza virus that mainly affects wild or domesticated birds. Bird flu spreads easily among birds, although transmission to humans is not common. Most human infections occur after exposure to infected birds or their droppings. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus arose in the late 1990s and proved to be highly pathogenic (causing severe illness and death) in birds. Since then, other strains of bird flu have been identified that also have the ability to cause severe disease and death. Human infections with a new avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China in March 2013."
